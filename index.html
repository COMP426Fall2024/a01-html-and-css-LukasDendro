        <h2>About Hercules</h2>
        <p>Hercules, known as Heracles in Greek mythology, is one of the most famous heroes in ancient lore. He was the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and a mortal woman named Alcmene, making him a demigod. Hercules is best known for his incredible strength and courage, traits that led him to undertake the Twelve Laborsâ€”tasks of immense difficulty assigned to him as penance for a crime. These labors included slaying the Nemean Lion, capturing the Golden Hind of Artemis, and cleaning the Augean stables, among others. After completing the labors, Hercules faced many more challenges in his life but ultimately met a tragic end. He was poisoned by a tunic smeared with the blood of the centaur Nessus, which caused unbearable pain. To escape his suffering, Hercules built a funeral pyre and was set alight, but upon his death, he was granted immortality and ascended to Mount Olympus, where he became a god.</p>
